            <p><strong>Score Files</strong>: The score file format is specified in the
                <a href="readme.txt">README.txt</a> contained in the <a href="data.html">MCTest data</a>. 
                A score file provides the given algorithm's score for each answer. We hope this will enable more 
                rapid progress on MCTest &ndash; by enabling each new algorithm to build on top of previous
                results, by allowing pairwise statistical significance testing, and by allowing
                anyone to investigate what kind of errors are being made by previous work.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Note</strong>: The accuracies reported here differ from those reported
            in the <a href="MCTest_EMNLP2013.pdf">paper</a>. The primary reason is in how ties are dealt with. Here, we 
            report accuracies using partial credit. That is, if three answers tie for highest score, 
            and one of them was right, then the algorithm gets 1/3 points for that question. This differs from 
            the published results which were computed by random tie-breaking. Partial credit
            is deterministic and more reproducable by others, as well as being less noisy. For this reason,
            we suggest that any results published using this data also use partial credit in the case
            of ties.
            </p>
            <p>Further, once we were using partial credit for tie-breaking, we were able to see that 
            there was an improvement in accuracy on the development set using a weight other than
            1 for combinining the sliding window and distance baselines (previously, this improvement was
            lost in the random noise induced by random tie breaking). The best weight for MC500
            was 11, and for MC160 it was 10 (for MC160 there is actually a tie for accuracy among weights 1
            and 10, among others, so we selected 10 on the assumption that the best weight
            on different datasets should be similar, and MC500 had more data and indicated an ideal
            weight of 11). This weight tuning was done purely on the development sets.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, there is a bug in the paper. The correct implmentation of Algorithm 2 (Distance Based Baseline)
                is to take an <em>average</em>, across all question words, of the minimum distance between that question word
                and one of the answer words. The paper accidentally says to take the <em>minimum</em> across the
                question words. 
            </p>
            <p>The original score files for the SW+D baseline, with a combination weight of 1, and taking the minimum instead of average
                when computing the distance based baseline, can be downloaded here: <a href="scores/BaselineInPaper_SW_D.scores.zip">BaselineInPaper_SW_D</a>
            </p>
            <p>UPDATE 11/5/2014: Fixed Baseline_SW_D.scores.zip, which had accidentally been created using a MC500 baseline
            combination weight of 10 instead of 11 and was normalizing the distance-based scores by |P| rather than |P|-1.</p>
